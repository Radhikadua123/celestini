# Introduction
Sonar (originally an acronym for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a technique
that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate 
with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.

## Design
We have designed a SONAR system using Arduino UNO which has a Servo motor connected to it which is used for getting
the angle by which the ultrasonic sensor mounted on it has rotated. The ultrasonic sensor is used for measuring the distance of the obtacle.
Processing has also been used for getting the distance from the obstacle and angle rotated, it also indicates if an object is in range or out of range
from the ultrasonic sensor.
