Celestini project focuses on using machine learning and data analytics on
a network of IoT or mobile devices to solve important socio-economic problems
(such as road safety, air pollution, water quality) where the data collected from sensors,
such as video cameras, air/water quality sensors, is used in real-time to make inferences, update models, and generate alerts.
